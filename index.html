        <p>When I was in high school and college, I remember feeling bored. <br>
         The world was wide open with possibilities of creating and recreating myself. <br>
         Yet, everything good in life seemed to be ahead of me. I was always waiting <br>
         for that good part. <br>
         This past year living in NYC was a challenge. Even though we feel fulfilled <br>
         in our careers, we had a hard time drawing boundaries between work and life. <br>
         Since travel, our hobby, became our work, it almost became impossible to <br>
         distinguish where to draw the line.</p>
